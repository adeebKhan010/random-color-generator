This is a simple random color generator app that generates a new color every time the button is clicked. The UI is painted with that newly generated color that looks really intuitive and eye-catching on the user interface. Here I have also used "navigator.clicked" function so that the hex code also gets copied every time the button is clicked to generat a different code.
